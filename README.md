| Category      | Technology                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**  | React 19, TypeScript                          |
| **AI**        | Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)           |
| **Styling**   | Tailwind CSS                                  |
| **State**     | React Context API & Custom `useLocalStorage` Hook |
| **Modules**   | Native ES Modules with `importmap`            |
| **Icons**     | Inline SVG Components                         |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need a modern web browser and a simple local server.

### Prerequisites

-   A Google Gemini API Key.
-   A local web server. You can use the `serve` package for a quick setup:
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gw-care.git
    cd gw-care
    ```
2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The Gemini API key is loaded via `process.env.API_KEY`. Since this is a client-side project without a build step, you will need to manually replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your actual API key for local development.

    *Note: In a production environment, this key should be handled through a backend proxy to keep it secure.*

### Running the App

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**
2.  **Start the local server:**
    ```bash
    serve .
    ```
3.  **Open your browser** and go to the local address provided by `serve` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The UI/UX is built around a calming and supportive theme.

-   **Color Palette:** A soothing palette of deep indigo (`#2A2F4F`), lavender (`#917FB3`), and soft pinks (`#E5BEEC`, `#FDE2F3`) creates a gentle and non-clinical environment.
-   **Mascot:** "Glowy" the mascot guides the user through the app, providing a friendly and empathetic presence.
-   **Layout:** A clean, responsive layout with generous whitespace ensures the interface feels uncluttered and easy to navigate on any device.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

-   **Backend Integration:** Develop a secure backend to enable user accounts, cross-device data synchronization, and secure API key management.
-   **PWA Features:** Implement service workers for full offline functionality and push notifications for daily reminders.
-   **Activate Premium Tiers:** Build out the infrastructure to connect users with certified counselors and doctors.
-   **Advanced Visualizations:** Enhance the dashboard with more detailed charts and trends based on emotion log history.
